*possibly try to make a boss parent class to add in base behavior but also to make the children detectable by spawner

*Possible idea is to create 5 different random zones that have each have a different end boss or to make themed zones with random bosses


Mini Bosses:
Shredder - large Sawblade projectiles with a lunge forward attach - *in progress

Bones - A bone throwing skeleton with small boomerang bone attacks

The King's Guardian - a easier version of the king with less movement and more spear thrusting








Mega Bosses:

Lord of Spikes - causes large spikes to appear / creates spike projectiles

The King - A large sword weilding king guy with sword slash attacks and sword projectiles

Lord Chronos - a 2 stage boss fight where once he dies the first time he rewinds time and heals up to full before getting stronger
